A commandline shell written in C. Does things like printing environment variables,
printing dir contents, remembers past history of user commands, and interfacing with the terminal
to respond to key presses. Shell can be used to launch custom compiled programs.

Must be executed through launcher.sh, and platform must be Ubuntu.
